Hi Umann Krist√≥f!

Unfortunately, due to the severe financial situation at Tesla Inc. as Elon Musk
smoked yet another joint on air, we're having to cut down on our workforce.
This impacts several teams at out company, such as yours, AutoPilot. With that
in mind, effective immediately, we're terminating your employment.

Please mind that we're eternally grateful for all the work you've done --
without you, we could not have made it even this far.

Bye,
Tesla Inc.
